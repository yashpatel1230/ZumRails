Hi ZumRails team,

You will find the api that is written in .net 6.
The UI is in angular 17.
It is a very simple UI that send basic requests and visualises the information it gets back.

Please note : 
The cors policy is implemented to accept requests only from the port from which the UI is running.
On my system it was http://localhost:4200, if you want to run it you will have to update it to your specific port.
